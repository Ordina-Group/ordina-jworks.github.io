## Introduction

This article stems from a moment of reflection during a drive home, where I pondered my apprenticeship and the learning process as a junior developer. 
This is aimed to comfort fellow juniors and newcomers and to offer relevant feedback to colleagues.

Using AI as a junior developer often provides a sense of hope and easy access to information, but this convenience comes with its own set of challenges when real (client) problems arise.
In the spirit of preserving knowledge and fostering honest communication, I felt compelled to share my perspective on this journey.

## Overview: The Dual Nature of AI in the Junior Developer Experience

As junior developers, we are heavy consumers of information. 
We love that "cooked" knowledge provided by experts and often accept it unquestioningly, building on it. The depth of these insights and experiences helps us retain information, carving it into stone.

In contrast, the quick, easy information provided by AI tools may feel useful at the moment but is often fleeting, like writing on the beach—easily erased by the next wave and quickly forgotten. I've experienced the feeling of solving a problem with AI’s help only to realize later that I can't remember how or why it worked. This led me to reflect on the types of information that stick and those that don’t.

### When AI is Incredibly Beneficial

AI can be highly advantageous when:

- **We need help with technologies outside our primary focus.**  
  For example, when I needed front-end code despite my primary focus being back-end development, AI tools provided fast and reliable assistance. This helps junior developers fill in knowledge gaps quickly, enabling them to move forward without getting stuck.

- **AI provides code snippets, templates, or solutions for unfamiliar areas.**  
  This can boost confidence and momentum, allowing us to progress through projects efficiently.

### The Drawbacks of Over-Reliance on AI

Despite its benefits, over-dependence on AI can have significant drawbacks:

#### 1. Quickly Forgotten Knowledge

AI-generated solutions might feel satisfying at the moment but are often quickly forgotten. Without hands-on practice and active problem-solving, this information doesn’t stick, leaving us with only a vague recollection.

#### 2. Dependency Addiction

Consistently prompting AI for help can lead to what I call **Dependency Addiction**, weakening critical skills such as:

- **Debugging and Troubleshooting:**  
  Relying on AI too much may prevent us from practicing error tracing and manual problem-solving.

- **Refactoring Skills:**  
  AI-generated code may work but lacks deep analysis, causing us to miss learning opportunities for improving or adapting the code.

- **Facing Outages:**  
  Imagine AI tools are unavailable and you encounter an issue. Without a habit of manual problem-solving, you may feel unprepared.

#### 3. Code Quality Risks

Quick AI-generated code may look functional but can often be a "can of bugs"—working initially but leading to more problems when deployed in production.

## Navigating AI as a Tool, Not a Crutch

Should we ride the AI wave? Yes, but with critical practices in place:

- **Review and Understand:**  
  Always review AI-generated code and understand how and why it works. Dissect it and use it as a learning opportunity.

- **Practice Without AI:**  
  Regularly write and debug code manually to build core skills.

- **Develop an Analytical Spirit:**  
  Treat problems as opportunities to think through solutions before resorting to AI. This fosters the analytical mindset needed for real-world development.

## The Apprentice Mindset: A Foundation for Junior Developers

### What Does It Mean to Be an Apprentice?

Marten Gustafson, an expert we interviewed, summed up the apprentice mindset beautifully: 

> “I guess it basically means having the attitude that there’s always a better/smarter/faster way to do what you just did and what you’re currently doing. Apprenticeship is the state/process of evolving and looking for better ways and finding people, companies, and situations that force you to learn those better/smarter/faster ways.”

Being an apprentice is about embracing continuous growth and self-improvement. It marks the start of your journey as a software craftsman, focusing on personal development and skill-building. While guidance from peers and senior developers is invaluable, the true essence of apprenticeship is learning how to grow independently and understanding how you learn best.

### Apprenticeship in Practice

Christopher Alexander said in *A Pattern Language*:

> “The fundamental learning situation is one in which a person learns by helping someone who really knows what he is doing.”

For junior developers, this means diving into projects, taking on tasks that push your comfort zone, and observing how more experienced colleagues solve problems. This type of learning builds practical wisdom that books and tutorials often can’t replicate.

### Tips for Junior Developers Embracing the Apprentice Journey

1. **Stay Curious and Humble**  
   Understand that there is always more to learn. Adopt Gustafson’s mindset—every task can be done better, and your current knowledge is just a stepping stone.

2. **Ask Questions Without Fear**  
   Jake Scruggs, in *“My Apprenticeship at Object Mentor”*, highlighted: 

   > “Tomorrow I need to look stupider and feel better about it. This staying quiet and trying to guess what’s going on isn’t working so well.”

   Don’t hesitate to ask questions. Staying silent and guessing hinders your learning more than asking questions does.

3. **Identify and Fill Skill Gaps**  
   It’s normal to feel like others have skills you lack. Instead of being discouraged, pick one skill and commit to mastering it. By filling these gaps, you build a strong foundation.

4. **Embrace Challenges and Learn from Mistakes**  
   Mistakes are part of learning. Treat each one as a chance to improve your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding.

5. **Code Reviews Are Compliments, Not Insults**  
   During my first code review, I felt disheartened by the feedback, especially since the codebase itself was flawed. However, I realized that code reviews are compliments—they signify someone investing time and expertise to help you grow.

## Balancing AI Assistance and Real Growth

While AI can be a powerful tool for quick solutions, ensure that it doesn’t become a crutch. Use it to complement your learning but also focus on developing strong analytical skills and comprehension. Quick fixes may solve problems but won’t always contribute to lasting growth.

Apprenticeship is about facing knowledge gaps and nurturing problem-solving instincts. Embrace this journey, stay patient, and remember that every challenge adds to your expertise.

## Conclusion

AI holds immense potential to support junior developers by providing quick solutions and knowledge. However, it’s essential to use it wisely. Without balance, it can become a crutch that leaves you unprepared for challenges that require deep, independent thinking. By integrating AI responsibly and focusing on foundational skills, we can transform it from a tool that blindsides us to one that illuminates our path to development expertise. Reflect on your habits, adapt, and share these insights with peers to navigate the modern developer's journey together.
