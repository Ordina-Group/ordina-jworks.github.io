## Introduction

Using AI as a junior developer often provides a sense of hope and easy access to information, 
but this convenience comes with its own set of challenges when real (client) problems arise. 
In the spirit of preserving knowledge and fostering honest communication, 
I felt compelled to share my perspective on this journey.

This article stems from a moment of reflection during a drive home,
where I pondered my apprenticeship and the learning process as a junior developer. 
This is aimed to comfort fellow juniors and newcomers and to offer relevant feedback to colleagues.

## Overview: The Dual Nature of AI in the Junior Developer Experience

As junior developers, we are heavy consumers of information. 
We love that "cooked" knowledge provided by experts and often accept it unquestioningly, building on it.
The depth of these insights and experiences helps us retain information, carving it into stone.

In contrast, the quick, easy information provided by AI tools may feel useful at the moment but is often fleeting, 
like writing on the beach—easily erased by the next wave and quickly forgotten.
I've experienced the feeling of solving a problem with AI’s help only to realize later that I can't remember how or why it worked.
This led me to reflect on the types of information that stick and those that don’t.

### When AI is Incredibly Beneficial

AI can be highly advantageous when:

- **We need help with technologies outside our primary focus.**  
  For example, when I needed front-end code despite my primary focus being back-end development, AI tools provided fast and reliable assistance.
  This helps junior developers fill in knowledge gaps quickly, enabling them to move forward without getting stuck.
   For instance, I was not familiar with Angular, but using AI to prompt me on how components work made it much easier to refactor and update my code.

- **AI provides code snippets, templates, or solutions for unfamiliar areas.**  
  AI can provide code snippets, templates, and solutions for areas that may be unfamiliar to developers. 
  This capability can significantly boost confidence and momentum, 
  enabling users to progress through projects more efficiently.
  For junior developers, this support can be particularly valuable when they encounter obstacles, 
  allowing them to overcome challenges and continue their work. 
 



### The Drawbacks of Over-Reliance on AI

Despite the numerous benefits that AI can offer, 
over-dependence on these tools can lead to significant drawbacks that affect our long-term development and problem-solving capabilities.

#### 1. Quickly Forgotten Knowledge

AI-generated solutions can provide immediate satisfaction and relief when faced with coding challenges.
However, the knowledge gained from these quick fixes is often ephemeral. 
When developers rely on AI without engaging in hands-on practice or active problem-solving, 
they miss the opportunity to solidify their understanding of the concepts at hand. Consequently, 
this leads to a situation where information fades away, leaving only a vague recollection of what was learned. 
This lack of retention can hinder our ability to tackle similar problems independently in the future.

#### 2. Dependency Addiction

An over-reliance on AI for assistance can create what I refer to as **Dependency Addiction**. 
This phenomenon can weaken critical skills essential for a developer's growth and proficiency, such as:

- ##### Debugging and Troubleshooting: 
  When juniors consistently turn to AI for help, 
  they may forego the practice of error tracing and manual problem-solving. 
  This reliance stifles their ability to identify and resolve issues independently, which is a crucial skill in any developer's toolkit.

- ##### Refactoring Skills:  
  Although AI-generated code may function correctly, it often lacks the nuanced analysis that comes from deep understanding. Developers may miss valuable learning opportunities related to improving or adapting code, as they may not fully grasp the rationale behind the changes suggested by AI.

- ##### Facing Outages: 
  Consider a scenario where AI tools become unavailable due to an outage. Without the habit of relying on manual problem-solving skills, developers may find themselves feeling unprepared and overwhelmed when confronted with an issue. This lack of readiness can lead to frustration and reduced productivity.

#### 3. Code Quality Risks

While AI can generate code quickly, this code may come with hidden risks. What may initially appear to be functional could quickly devolve into a "can of bugs"—working under certain conditions but leading to unforeseen problems when deployed in a production environment. Such issues can stem from a lack of thorough testing, understanding of best practices, or consideration of the specific context in which the code will operate. Ultimately, this can result in technical debt and increased maintenance costs, undermining the advantages that AI was supposed to provide.


## Navigating AI as a Tool, Not a Crutch

Should we ride the AI wave? Yes, but with critical practices in place:

- **Review and Understand:**  
  Always review AI-generated code and understand how and why it works. 
  Dissect it and use it as a learning opportunity.

- **Practice Without AI:**  
  Regularly write and debug code manually to build core skills.

- **Develop an Analytical Spirit:**  
  Treat problems as opportunities to think through solutions before resorting to AI. 
  This fosters the analytical mindset needed for real-world development.

## The Apprentice Mindset: A Foundation for Junior Developers

### What Does It Mean to Be an Apprentice?

Marten Gustafson, an expert we interviewed, summed up the apprentice mindset beautifully: 

> “I guess it basically means having the attitude that there’s always a better/smarter/faster way to do what you just did and what you’re currently doing. Apprenticeship is the state/process of evolving and looking for better ways and finding people, companies, and situations that force you to learn those better/smarter/faster ways.”

Being an apprentice is about embracing continuous growth and self-improvement. 
It marks the start of your journey as a software craftsman, 
focusing on personal development and skill-building. While guidance from peers and senior developers is invaluable, 
the true essence of apprenticeship is learning how to grow independently and understanding how you learn best.

### Apprenticeship in Practice

Christopher Alexander said in *A Pattern Language*:

> “The fundamental learning situation is one in which a person learns by helping someone who really knows what he is doing.”

For junior developers, this means diving into projects, 
taking on tasks that push your comfort zone, and observing how more experienced colleagues solve problems. 
This type of learning builds practical wisdom that books and tutorials often can’t replicate.

## Tips for Junior Developers Embracing the Apprentice Journey

1. **Stay Curious and Humble**  
Understand that there is always more to learn. 
Embrace the experience of not knowing something and the journey of learning it. 
I’ve encountered people with remarkable, respectable experience, yet they remain eager and open to learning more. 
Their humility and curiosity show that even the most knowledgeable individuals recognize the endless possibilities for growth. 
This mindset can inspired me to stay curious, push my boundaries, and continuously evolve.

2. **Ask Questions Without Fear**  
   Jake Scruggs, in *“My Apprenticeship at Object Mentor”*, highlighted: 

   > “Tomorrow I need to look stupider and feel better about it. This staying quiet and trying to guess what’s going on isn’t working so well.”

   Don’t hesitate to ask questions. 
   Staying silent and guessing hinders your learning more than asking questions does.

3. **Identify and Fill Skill Gaps**  
    It’s normal to feel like others have skills you lack. 
    Instead of being discouraged, pick one skill and commit to mastering it. 
    By filling these gaps, you build a strong foundation.

4. **Embrace Challenges and Learn from Mistakes**  
    Mistakes are an essential part of the learning process. Treat each one as an opportunity to improve your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding. 
    Sometimes, I deliberately make mistakes to learn about their impact on the codebase. 
    Why do I do this? It’s simply how I feel most comfortable learning, **A BEHAVIORAL PATTERN**.
    I find it motivating to make a mistake, then either figure out the solution myself or learn from someone correcting me.

5. **Your Learning Pattern Is Defined By You**  

    In my opinion, you should harness your energy and motivation to shape a learning path that suits you best.

    Don’t get me wrong—I’m not here to sell you independence just for the sake of it. 
    What I’m trying to express is that you shouldn’t consume all the information presented to you without discretion. Take it in thoughtfully so you know how relevant it is for you.

    Uncle Bob, for example, offers great insights, and I’ve certainly learned a lot from him to improve as a programmer. 
    At the same time, though, there are a few concepts I sometimes find to be a bit "nonesence".


6. **Code Reviews Are Compliments, Not Insults**  
   During my first code review, I felt disheartened by the feedback, especially since the codebase itself was flawed. 
   However, I realized that code reviews are compliments—they signify someone investing time and expertise to help you grow.


## Conclusion

AI holds immense potential to support junior developers by providing quick solutions and accessible knowledge. 
However, it’s essential to use it wisely and ensure it doesn’t become a crutch. 
While AI can be a powerful tool for quick fixes, true growth comes from developing strong analytical skills and deep comprehension. 
Quick solutions may address immediate issues but won’t always contribute to lasting growth or prepare you for complex challenges.

By integrating AI responsibly and focusing on foundational skills,
we can transform it from a tool that blindsides us into one that illuminates our path toward development expertise. 
Reflect on your habits, adapt thoughtfully, and share these insights with peers to navigate the modern developer's journey together.

Apprenticeship is about facing knowledge gaps, creating your own leraning pattern, nurturing problem-solving instincts, and embracing the journey with patience. 
Remember, every challenge adds to your expertise, and balancing AI assistance with real learning builds a foundation for a successful and sustainable career.
